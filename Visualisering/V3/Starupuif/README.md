# Starupuif - Exam project
This assigment was and exam project for V3. The customer was a small club, that arranged different activities and wanted a website to display these and enable a simple registration function. The site had to contain:
..* An index where all the future events where displayed.
..* A filtering system to filter events by category.
..* Very simple registration system.
..* Signing in and out.
..* Creating new events.
All of this was made using html, css(scss), javascript and php. The styling was mainly made by using bootstrap.

## Index

Only future events are displayed and can be filtered by category. The nav is made so as when a user with the right privilege signs in, new events can be created.
