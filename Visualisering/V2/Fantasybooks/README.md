# Fantasybooks - V2 exam project
The assignment was to make a website for a bookstore which had to contain some predetermined elements:
..* Slideshow at the index page.
..* Animations on the references to the other pages on the index page.
..* The style should be inspired by an old library or study
..* Responsive 
These were the main elements that had to be incorporated in the assignment. The pictures and all of the text was handed out with the assignment description.
Everything on the page is made using html, css and javascript

## Index
The homepage consists of a slideshow, short description and 3 elements each a picture with some text.
### Slideshow

### Animations
The animations have been used on the images on all of the 3 sections. When hovering an almost opaque overlay covers the image so the attention of the user is caught and the user lead on to other pages of the site.

## Second handstore
The customer wanted an simplified shop. This was achieved by simply making a list of all the books available

## Responsive
The site is responsive and uses a classic hamburger menu when in mobile view. The hamburger menu is made by using javascript.
